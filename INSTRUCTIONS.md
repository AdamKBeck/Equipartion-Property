# Equipartion-Property
A STAT 333 project studying the equipartition property of various events.
1  (25 pts).  Study the equipartition property for Mathematica (pseudo)-random number generator, and the Champernowne  string (of different length, in base 2, at levels 1, 2 ,and 3) . Provide a graphical representation of your results
--------------------------
2   ((25 pts).  Study the equipartition property for    the binary and decimal expansions (of different length, at levels 1 and 2) of  number e. Provide a graphical representation of your results

 _______________________

3 (25 pts): Develop the mathematical model and picture the phase space diagram for the physical (idealized) coin toss. Calculate some "probabilities"  of  HEADS UP given the information about the initial vertical velocity v and angular velocity w of the coin. Assume some concrete numerical values of v and w, plus/minus some "error".

Bonus (5): Can you prove rigorously that if v and w go to infinity then the above "probabilities" converge to 1/2?

__________________________
4    (25 pts) .  Experiment with the  UVW`Billiard'  package, varying parameters of the model. Print out some more interesting results and provide a short commentary(remember figure captions). 

 See if you can design some interesting scientific experiments using the package (such as showing the  dependence of the time of onset of the "chaotic behavior" on the size of the obstacle, etc)
